# --- FFmpeg Location (Choose ONE method) ---
# This setting tells the script where to find the FFmpeg executable.

# Method 1: FFmpeg is already installed on your system (Common on Linux/macOS).
#   - To find the path, open your terminal and run: which ffmpeg
#   - Paste the output here.
#   - If the command works, you can often just leave this setting BLANK, and yt-dlp will find it automatically.
#
# Example for Linux:
# ffmpeg_location = /usr/bin/ffmpeg

# Method 2: Use a portable FFmpeg (Recommended for Windows).
#   - Place ffmpeg.exe (Windows) or ffmpeg (macOS/Linux) in this project's main folder.
#   - Use the path below that matches your operating system.

# For macOS or Linux:
