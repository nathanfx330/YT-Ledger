**Notes on the packages:**

*   **`yt-dlp`**: The core tool for downloading video information. It's good practice to specify a version you know works.
*   **`openpyxl`**: For creating the Excel (`.xlsx`) report.
*   **`Pillow`**: A fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), used for processing thumbnails before inserting them into the Excel file.
*   **`requests`**: Used for downloading thumbnails efficiently.
*   **`fpdf2`**: The library used to create PDF reports. It's the modern, maintained fork of `fpdf`.

### 2. Conda `environment.yml`

This file is for users of the Conda package manager. It's more powerful than `requirements.txt` as it can manage non-Python dependencies and specify the exact Python version.

**`environment.yml`**

# Conda environment configuration for the YT-Ledger project.
