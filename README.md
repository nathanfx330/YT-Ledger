# YT-Ledger: YouTube Archival & Reporting Pipeline

**YT-Ledger** is a powerful Python script that uses [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to create a comprehensive archival pipeline for YouTube playlists and individual videos. It fetches detailed metadata, optionally downloads videos and subtitles, and generates professional, easy-to-read reports in **XLSX**, **HTML**, and **PDF** formats.

---

## üîë Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple YouTube playlists and individual video URLs/IDs in one go.
- **Video Archiving**: Download videos, thumbnails, subtitles, and `.info.json` metadata files.
- **Cookie Support**: Use browser cookies to access age-restricted, private, or members-only videos.
- **High-Quality Downloads**: Automatically selects and merges the best video/audio formats (e.g., 1080p).
- **Multi-Format Reporting**:
  - **Excel (`.xlsx`)**: Spreadsheet with metadata and embedded thumbnails.
  - **HTML (`.html`)**: Searchable local webpage with clickable links.
  - **PDF (`.pdf`)**: Clean, portable summary report with Unicode font support.
- **Efficient**: Concurrent thumbnail downloading improves performance.
- **Configurable**: Fully managed via a single `config.ini` file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Setup

### 1. Install FFmpeg

This is a **critical dependency** for downloading high-quality video/audio.

1. Download FFmpeg from: [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)  
   (Recommended: [gyan.dev builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) or [BtbN builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds))
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Find the `ffmpeg` executable in the `bin` folder.
4. **Copy** it to the root of your YT-Ledger folder (same level as `main.py`):  
   - `ffmpeg.exe` on Windows  
   - `ffmpeg` on macOS/Linux

### 2. Get the Fonts for PDF Reports

The PDF generator uses **DejaVu fonts** for full Unicode compatibility. Fonts are pre-included in the `fonts/` directory.

### 3. Clone the Project & Set Up Environment

#### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanfx330/YT-Ledger.git
cd YT-Ledger
```

#### Set Up Python Environment

Choose **one** of the following:

**A) Using `venv` + `pip`:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**B) Using Conda (Recommended):**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate yt-ledger
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### 4. Create Your `config.ini` File

```bash
 config.ini
```

Edit `config.ini` in your preferred text editor. At a minimum, set:

- `playlist_id` under `[youtube]`
- `ffmpeg_location` under `[downloads]`

For age-restricted/private content, provide your `cookies.txt` path under `cookies_file`.

---

## üöÄ Usage

Once your environment is activated and configuration is ready, run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Progress is logged to both the console and `yt_ledger.log`.
